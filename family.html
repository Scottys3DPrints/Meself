                <h2>My German Relatives</h2>
                <p class="relatives_p">My Mother is from the Stuttgart area, I grew up and lived in the same city that
                    she grew up in, which is Freiberg am Neckar. My mother has two brothers
                    and a sister, all of which live within 15 mins of each other and so do my german grandparents. I
                    very much enjoyed having my extended family so close to me,
                    we were very close to each other and got a long very well.

                <h2>My US-Relatives</h2>
                <p class="relatives_p">My Dad is from the US, is was born in Salt Lake City and grew up in a town called
                    Wallsburg. After his mission he was working for Bosch and went on a
                    business trip to germany, there he went to a YSA Dance where he met my mother. She was going to the
                    US the next summer and so they met again and started dating and eventually
                    married in the US. After one year I was born and one year after that we moved back to germany but we
                    still visit our family in the US every year or two.
